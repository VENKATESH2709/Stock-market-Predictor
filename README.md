Stock Market Predictor using LSTM Model and Streamlit
Overview
This project aims to predict stock market prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, deployed as an interactive web application using the Streamlit library. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

The application allows users to input historical stock data, configure model parameters, and obtain predictions for future stock prices.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-predictor.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd stock-market-predictor
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server, and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Features
Data Input: Users can upload historical stock data in CSV format.
Model Configuration: Users can adjust various parameters of the LSTM model, such as the number of layers, hidden units, and dropout rate.
Prediction: Once the model is trained, users can input a date range for which they want to predict stock prices.
Visualization: The application provides interactive visualizations of both historical and predicted stock prices.
Model Training
The LSTM model is trained using historical stock data provided by the user. The training process involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and validation sets, and training the model using backpropagation.
